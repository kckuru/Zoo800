## Distributions in Ecology

# Central Limit Theorem
# -> The distribution of sample means (means of whatever value you are measuring) 
# -> converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases
# --> As sample sizes increases, the distribution of averages becomes MORE NORMAL and NARROWER (bunny video)
# ---> This is true regardless of the shape of the underlying distribution

# Types of non-normal response data in ecological studies
# 1. Counts (quadrats, line transects) -> normal distribution must be CONTINUOUS
# 2. Proportions (number of individuals that have a characteristic / total number of individuals)
# 3. Categorical (male/female, benthic/pelagic)

# Each data type has a typical probability distribution associated with it
# -> Counts of events within a given sampling unit are POISSON distributed if the rate (density) is constant,
# -> and they are independent (not clumped in space or time or spread out)
# --> Discrete probability distribution (integer values from 0 to inf)
# ---> Single parameter: mean = variance = lambda (Î»)
# ----> Clumped data give rise to overdispersion: variance > mean
# -----> Negative binomial can be a better option for overdispersed count data

# Poisson (counts) examples
# -> As mean gets larger, variance gets larger
# -> Count data with a large enough mean can be approximated with a normal distribution

# Binomial distribution used for total number of "sucesses" in a fixed number of trials
# -> Discrete probability distribution (integer values from 0 to n)
# -> Two parameters: number of trials (n) and probability of success (p)
# --> Variance = n*p*(1-p)
# ---> When n is large and p is not close to 0 or 1, can be approximated with a normal distribution
# ----> 0.5 is p when the variance is maximized (according to the equation)

# Each of these data types has a typical probability distribution
# -> The distribution of p can be defined based on the results of n independent trials
# -> using the beta distribution
# --> Continuous probability distribution (values between 0 and 1) and parameters alpha and beta
# ---> Distribution of p is a beta with alpha-1 "sucesses" and beta-1 "failures"

# Beta distribution examples
# -> As alpha and beta get larger, the distribution gets more normal
# -> When alpha = beta, the distribution is symmetric around 0.5
# -> When alpha > beta, the distribution is skewed right
# -> When alpha < beta, the distribution is skewed left
# -> When alpha and beta are both less than 1, the distribution is U-shaped

# Exponential family
# -> Normal (Gaussian), Poisson, Binomial, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian
# --> Can be expressed in a common mathematical form
# ---> Allows for a unified approach to statistical modeling (Generalized Linear Models)

# Distributions in R
# -> rnorm() -> draw random variables from the specified distribution
# -> dnorm() -> the probability density ar any point
# -> pnorm() -> tail probabilities to the left or right of the specified point
# -> Similar r-, d-, and p- syntax for other distributions: ex: rpois, runif, etc.

# How can our results be replicable if they involve generating random observations?
# -> Set a seed before generating random numbers using set.seed()
# --> This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the code is run

# Using random numbers in R to select a random subset of observations
# -> create a new column in your df
# --> fill with random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution
# ---> sort the df by the random number column
# ----> select the first n rows for your random sample

# Fitting distributions and distribution tests
# -> MASS and fitdistrplus packages
# --> denscomp() plot function
